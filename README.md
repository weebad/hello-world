# hello-world
I hereby give this repository the title of "my tutorial repository".

Hi there, not sure why you're reading this but you do you.
Ayways, this is all a part of my tutorial learning github and how it works. So far it has been better than reading fat books that don't make up for practical learning. 
so yeah, COMMIT CHANGE HERE
